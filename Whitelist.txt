# Pi-hole Whitelist
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PURPOSE:
#   This file defines domains that are essential to business operations
#   and should be excluded from Pi-hole blocking.
#
#   It is imported into both Pi-hole servers in a high-availability (HA)
#   configuration using rsync and cron. Domains listed here bypass
#   Pi-hole's gravity-based blocking to ensure reliable access.
#
# FORMAT:
#   - Plaintext file
#   - One fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) per line
#   - No wildcards, IPs, or subdomain patterns
#   - Comment lines begin with "#"
#
# USAGE:
#   Hosted on GitHub and imported via:
#     curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nths-it/pihole-whitelist/main/whitelist.txt | xargs -L1 pihole --white-list
#
#   Or used in gravity sync scripts between nodes:
#     rsync /etc/pihole/whitelist.txt <backup-node>:/etc/pihole/
#     systemctl restart pihole-FTL
